### To Haoyu:
Clone the porject, open it with Intelij
Use git to make your own branch for development
Once you are done your branch (AND IT RUNS OK), then you can "git push" to this directory
Then, you make a pull request, and attach your branch to the pull request. This will let us sort any code conflicts (duplicate lines, etc)
